# BAES Governance

## Babak AI Engineering Standard

**Status:** Under Development  
**Document Type:** Public Governance Overview

---

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the publicly available governance model of the
Babak AI Engineering Standard (BAES).

Its purpose is to establish how significant engineering decisions,
changes, reviews, and releases are governed while preserving the
distinction between:

- Intent
- Authority
- Decision
- Execution
- Review
- Publication

This document does not disclose restricted BAES Foundation material.

---

## 2. Governance Philosophy

BAES treats governance as a distinct engineering concern.

The ability to perform an action does not automatically establish the
authority to decide that the action should be performed.

Likewise:

```text
Capability
    ≠
Authority
````

and:

```text
Execution
    ≠
Decision
```

Governance exists to maintain these distinctions.

---

## 3. Human Engineering Authority

BAES development operates under human engineering authority.

Human authority is responsible for establishing and protecting:

* Project intent
* Project scope
* Governance boundaries
* Publication boundaries
* Acceptance of significant engineering decisions
* Acceptance of significant changes
* Release authorization

AI systems may participate in engineering activities but do not
automatically acquire governance authority through participation.

---

## 4. AI Participation

AI systems may assist with BAES development.

Examples include:

* Research
* Analysis
* Drafting
* Classification
* Evaluation
* Documentation
* Cross-reference analysis
* Case-study analysis
* Technical exploration

AI participation does not automatically grant:

* Decision authority
* Governance authority
* Publication authority
* Scope authority
* Release authority

AI-generated material remains subject to the applicable review and
decision process.

**Boundary note:** The authority terminology used in this public governance
overview describes governance concerns and distinctions under development.
It does not, by itself, establish an independent Foundation-level
Authority or Governance ontology. The current research state preserves
that distinction.

---

## 5. Authority Model

BAES distinguishes between several forms of authority.

### 5.1 Intent Authority

Authority concerning the intended purpose and direction of BAES.

---

### 5.2 Scope Authority

Authority concerning what is and is not within the declared scope of
BAES.

---

### 5.3 Decision Authority

Authority to accept a significant engineering decision.

---

### 5.4 Execution Authority

Authority to perform an approved action.

---

### 5.5 Review Authority

Authority to conduct or authorize a review.

---

### 5.6 Publication Authority

Authority to determine whether material may enter the public
engineering record.

---

### 5.7 Release Authority

Authority to approve and publish a formal BAES release.

---

## 6. Authority Is Delegated, Not Transferred

Where authority is delegated, the delegation should be explicit.

Delegation should identify, where applicable:

* Delegating authority
* Receiving party
* Delegated authority
* Scope of delegation
* Limitations
* Duration
* Revocation conditions

Delegation does not necessarily transfer ultimate governance
responsibility.

---

## 7. Governance vs Execution

BAES maintains a distinction between deciding that an action is
authorized and performing that action.

Conceptually:

```text
Governance
    ↓
Authorization
    ↓
Execution
    ↓
Verification
    ↓
Review
```

Execution should not be interpreted as evidence that the underlying
decision was properly authorized.

---

## 8. Decision Lifecycle

Significant decisions should be traceable through an explicit
lifecycle.

A simplified lifecycle is:

```text
Question / Problem
        ↓
Investigation
        ↓
Decision Proposal
        ↓
Review
        ↓
Decision
        ↓
Implementation
        ↓
Verification
```

The exact process may vary according to the nature and significance of
the decision.

---

## 9. Change Governance

Significant changes should be explicitly recorded.

A typical change lifecycle is:

```text
Change Proposal
       ↓
Impact Analysis
       ↓
Review
       ↓
Approval
       ↓
Implementation
       ↓
Validation
       ↓
Record Update
```

A proposed change is not automatically an authorized change.

---

## 10. Review Independence

Where appropriate, important artifacts should be independently
reviewable.

Independent review may be particularly valuable for:

* Significant specification changes
* Normative material
* Governance changes
* Evidence-sensitive decisions
* Major releases
* High-impact case studies

The required level of independence depends on the significance and
risk of the artifact under review.

---

## 11. Publication Governance

Not every artifact created during BAES development is necessarily
intended for immediate public release.

Publication status may include:

```text
Restricted
    ↓
Pending Publication Review
    ↓
Approved for Publication
    ↓
Public
```

Material may remain restricted when publication would:

* Prematurely expose unfinished work
* Reveal sensitive development material
* Create confusion about the current standard
* Expose internal research
* Require further validation

Publication is therefore a governed engineering action.

---

## 12. Foundation Protection

BAES contains foundational engineering work that may not be publicly
released during development.

The public governance model therefore recognizes a distinction between:

```text
Public BAES Material
        and
Restricted BAES Material
```

The existence of restricted material does not imply that it is
normative, final, or immutable.

Its publication is controlled independently.

---

## 13. Scope Governance

BAES does not permit implicit scope expansion.

A proposal that introduces a new domain, purpose, authority model, or
major capability should be explicitly identified as a potential scope
change.

Conceptually:

```text
Proposal
   ↓
Scope Assessment
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Implementation
```

A contributor, document, AI system, or individual action cannot
unilaterally redefine BAES scope.

---

## 14. Governance Records

Significant governance events should be traceable through appropriate
records.

Relevant record types include:

* Decision Records
* Change Records
* Review Records
* Research Records
* Case Study Records
* Release Records

Templates for these records are maintained under:

`templates/`

---

## 15. Traceability

BAES aims to preserve a traceable relationship between significant
engineering events.

A simplified model is:

```text
Research
   ↓
Decision
   ↓
Change
   ↓
Review
   ↓
Release
```

Not every artifact must pass through every stage.

However, when a stage is materially relevant, its relationship should
be identifiable.

---

## 16. Governance Questions

For significant actions, the following questions should be answerable:

1. What is being changed or decided?
2. Why is it being changed or decided?
3. What evidence supports the action?
4. Who has authority to make the decision?
5. Who has authority to execute it?
6. What is the authorized scope?
7. What review is required?
8. What are the consequences?
9. How will the result be verified?
10. Where is the decision recorded?

If these questions cannot be answered, the governance state may be
insufficiently defined.

---

## 17. Governance and Evidence

Governance decisions should not be confused with evidence claims.

In particular:

```text
Decision
    ≠
Evidence

Evidence
    ≠
Validity

Validity
    ≠
Authority
```

A decision may be made under uncertainty.

When uncertainty is material, it should be represented explicitly
rather than hidden by the decision record.

---

## 18. Governance and AI

AI systems may assist governance activities such as:

* Identifying inconsistencies
* Summarizing evidence
* Detecting missing information
* Performing impact analysis
* Suggesting alternatives
* Supporting review

However, AI assistance does not automatically constitute governance
authority.

Where AI produces a recommendation, the recommendation should remain
distinguishable from the human decision that accepts, modifies, or
rejects it.

---

## 19. Conflict Handling

When two governance-relevant artifacts appear to conflict, the conflict
should be made explicit.

The preferred approach is:

```text
Identify Conflict
       ↓
Record Conflict
       ↓
Determine Applicable Authority
       ↓
Review
       ↓
Decision
       ↓
Update Traceability
```

Conflicts should not be silently resolved by changing one artifact
without recording the reason.

---

## 20. Governance Failure Modes

BAES recognizes several potential governance failure modes, including:

* Implicit authority
* Uncontrolled delegation
* Unauthorized scope expansion
* Unreviewed normative changes
* Confusion between recommendation and decision
* Confusion between execution and authorization
* Publication of immature material
* Loss of decision traceability
* Evidence being treated as automatically valid
* AI-generated material being treated as authoritative

These failure modes should be considered during appropriate reviews.

---

## 21. Emergency Actions

Certain engineering situations may require immediate action to
prevent significant harm to the project, its artifacts, or its
engineering record.

Emergency mechanisms may therefore exist where appropriate.

Any emergency action should be:

* Explicitly identified as an emergency action
* Limited to the necessary scope
* Recorded
* Reviewed retrospectively where appropriate
* Reconciled with normal governance processes

The existence of an emergency mechanism should not become a mechanism
for routine bypass of governance.

---

## 22. Governance Evolution

The governance model of BAES is itself subject to controlled
engineering evolution.

Future changes may introduce:

* Additional authority categories
* More detailed approval levels
* Risk-based governance
* Delegation mechanisms
* Formal release gates
* Conformance governance
* External review mechanisms

Such changes should themselves be traceable.

---

## 23. Current Governance Status

BAES governance is currently under development.

This document describes the public governance model at its current
stage.

It should not be interpreted as a complete disclosure of all internal
or restricted governance mechanisms.
